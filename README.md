# Final-Project---Bachelor-s-degree

The aim of this project is to calculate the power that a propulsion engine should have for a pasara-type boat. Ideal conditions at sea were observed,
ie without wind, waves and underwater currents. Also, the project includes determining the external characteristics of the boat and predicting a standard
propeller.

Most calculations were done using MATLAB.
